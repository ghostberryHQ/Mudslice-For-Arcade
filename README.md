# Project Mudslice
- Project Mudslice is an attempt to change how music is streamed to the viewers.
- In this repository, you will find some pages I designed in NextJS/React for this project. As this is NOT a shipped project, you will not find all the code but instead just the designed pages
- A fully shipped project will come at a later date
- This project was started in Buildspace and HackClub Arcade during the 2024 summer
